# HE

HE is a script used for extracting information from a Hansoft database to an Excel workbook saved at a specified location, it also provides the option of running VBA macros in the export workbook.

HE uses HansoftExport (1) for the extraction from Hansoft. HansoftExport in turn uses EPPlus (2), SimpleLogging (3) and ObjectWrapper (4). All of these programs can be found on github and need to be built succesfully for HE to run.
